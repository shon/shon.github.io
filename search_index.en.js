However during the implementation team bowed to\nthe delivery pressure and couldn't get a chance to learn, explore and\nuse knockout or any other MVC library. Certainly a mistake! Ultimately\nwe have to paid the price of having to maintain really complex pure\njquery based bug-prone codebase. However at this stage, I decided to\nrectify this and started looking for different client side templating\nand MVC libraries. Essentially the library that binds the templates to\ndata and can auto-update as the data changes. I was stunned by choice of\nlibraries/frameworks available. There are just too many of them. Ones I\nliked are\n\nknockout.js\nangular.js\nEmber.js\nAgility\nknockback\n\nEmber is perhaps the best one even according to this\npost.\nAngular is very capable and is sheer magic. And well there are many more\nlike excellent backbone.js. We finally narrowed down two options:\nKnockout and Agility. Agility, I liked most, mainly because of it's\nclear syntax and looked like producing very maintainable code. So it was\nreally tempting to go for it. But for us at this point of time knockout\nscored better at mainly with it's project maturity (age). Agility is at\n0.1.2 at this moment and knockout 2.0.0 and hence knockout enjoys much\nbigger community.\nSo while we go ahead now with knockout I will certainly keep an eye on\nagility's development would love to find an excuse to use it.\n","id":"https://shon.github.io/blog/choosing-mvvc-library-for-cowspa/","title":"Choosing MVC(MVVM) library for Cowspa"},"https://shon.github.io/blog/configuring-your-ubuntu-for-faster-internet-access/":{"body":"While there is a lot already written here my quick howto\n\nConfigure your browser to use 127.0.0.1:8080.

We are a bunch of\ngeeks who code for living.\n\nTickets were a bit expensive but we were really curious, reading with\npositive reviews all over (five stars and all). The expectation was\nwatching desi Lord of the rings equivalent. So winning argument in\nfavour of watching Bahubali was \"if they have sepnd 250cr making it, it\nshould be worth spending extra 150 Rs. to watch it\". Argument is sily\nbut fine, everyone really wanted to watch it. So we applied 20% discount\noffer on bookmyshow and booked the tickets.\nWe reached in time. And it began. Waterfall scenes were mesmerizing.\nInitial few minutes we were convinced that Bahubali is no ordinary boy\n.. he has great powers. Fine. He finds the mask and he decides to reach\ntop. Fine. As he reached top of the waterfall and the love story story\nbegins\nOh man .. from then until the interval it was crap [Crapbali]. Tatoo\nin flowing water, the heroine leading warriors and then convincing the\ntribe leader to have Bahubali lead them .. all so unconvincing even with\ncreative freedom. We were looking at each other with the feeling what\ncrap are we watching.\nAlright post interval Bada Bahubali appears and then things were bit\nmore interesting. Battle scene was epic and most of did enjoy it. But it\nwasn't without flaws either. How come Rani maa could watch such huge\nbattlefield like she is in some balcony watching a football or a cricket\nmatch .. and many more such logical questions.\nThen as we were walking back to office, we stopped at a cafe and then\ndiscussions started\n\nPD: Arey, me and Pi have a question for you\n\n\nME: Ok..\n\n\nPi: Who was the old lady who carried baby Bahubali through stream\n\n\nME: Umm.. had same question in my mind but let me think\n\n\nRR: See Rani maa was not Bahubali's real mother she was Duggubati's\nmother, right?\n\n\nME: You mean Bada Bahubali..\n\n\nPi: What about Devsena\n\n\n...\n...\n\nThere were more discussions and debates as we ordered some food. Two\nthings that everyone agreed on\n\nFirst half was utter crap\nSecond half was entertaining for sure but with many flaws\n\nBest scene in the movie\nKattappa doing Shahrukh Khan in a scene where he runs to\nkill chota Bahubali, changes his mind midway as he running and slides\nConclusion\nThey could have done better job with dialogues. I mean\n\nMera vachan hi hai shaasan\n\nwait .. what?\nSongs are forgettable, not sure why are they even there.\nGood movies stay in it's genre. For example many\nGovinda/Jim carry comedy movies do try to be serious. They often do one\nthing and do it well. Epic/Superhero/Disaster movies has great graphics\nbut most of the times do not try to be stupid love story.\nBahubali appeared to be intense historical fiction filled with struggle\nfor power, battles, politics. Sure there is place for tender love and\nhuman relations provided they are convincing. You can't turn on stupid\nmode for an hour long love story and then switch serious mode when\nsecond half begins.\nBahubali is big budget movie so there was no lack of resources to make a\ngreat movie. Still you can't help but get the feeling that the epic\nbattle scene is the only (technology) achievement but other than\nthat movie just disappoints on all fronts.\nAnd if you ask me to rate the movie... well two stars or may be just\none star .\nAlso read Wogma's review.\n","id":"https://shon.github.io/blog/crapbali/","title":"Crapbali"},"https://shon.github.io/blog/dns-migration-story/":{"body":"System administration is not my job but then sometimes I need to wear that hat to help the team.

Specifically, a tool that offers easy access/collaboration, robust search, and supports AI queries. I had stumbled upon getoutline.com sometime back, and have been eager to explore it since! If you haven't heard of it, Outline is a fantastic, open-source team knowledge base that’s designed to be fast, collaborative, and super easy to use. It's a powerful and cost-effective option right off the bat! Though, I do wish that they had a better domain name 😉.\nMy main goals for this exploration:\n\nMigrate our existing GitHub Wiki\nPublish part of the wiki as a public help site\nTry out a product with AI-powered search/querying\n\nSo, how did it go? Let's dive in! 👇\nMinor Hurdle 1: Sign up\nCould not sign up with an individual email. One needs a corporate SSO account such as Google workspace or Slack.\nOnce signed up, I cloned my GitHub wiki repository.\nUsed ChatGPT to write a script that imports all the content (markdown and images) to Outline using its API.\nMinor Hurdle 2: Rate Limits\nThe API has somewhat restrictive rate limiting for import, which was then overcome with a 60-second sleep between the calls.\nImported content as a collection. The import worked and looked great.\nI figured out that a collection cannot be published (made public) directly. However, a document can be published, and its nested documents are automatically published.\nI modified the script for this and then published the main document. It worked perfectly!\nI then looked into making certain links friendly. For example, changing /s/guide/doc/sharing-LG2sGOLIpl to /s/guide/doc/sharing without the ID suffix. The Documentation suggests this works, but my testing indicates otherwise.\nHere is the script and usage instructions here if someone is interested.\nCustom domain is available for about $240 per year, so I am skipping that. Also, there is no option in the settings, but it's a manual process based on a support request. I decided to skip it.\n\nConclusion\nSo far, the Outline experience has been positive! It's a user-friendly and highly capable platform for managing team knowledge, with great APIs. It is a powerful alternative to wikis/Notion, especially if you're on a budget.\nFor our internal Engineering knowledge base, Outline offers several key advantages:\n\nPowerful Search: GitHub's native search functionality can be limiting. Outline's search is much better. Its built-in AI queries are particularly effective at understanding natural language questions and providing answers based on our existing documentation.\nIntuitive Editor: Outline's editor is far more capable and user-friendly. Its intuitive design and collaborative features make it easy for both developers and non-developers to contribute and update content.\nEnhanced Collaboration: Outline supports real-time collaborative editing, which will be especially useful for updating complex deployment procedures and other shared tasks. It also has a native commenting system, making feedback and discussions more streamlined.\nFlexible Sharing: We can selectively share documents publicly, a feature that will be handy for external-facing documentation.\nNo Vendor Lock-in: Top-notch Markdown support for import/export helps.\nPricing: At a price of $10 per month for 10 users, it's a very affordable solution.\n\nThese were the most compelling reasons for the switch. As we begin using the platform, we'll also be able to explore other features like better content organization, APIs, and advanced access controls.\n\nIssues (Mostly minor)\n\n\nI miss the ability of editing markdown files in your favorite editor (neovim in my case).\nI feel the WYSIWYG approach makes a product more accessible but makes both read and write a bit harder as the interface would have to be ready to handle both intents.\nExample: Clicking a link while reading sometimes opens it for editing. Using space to pagedown is not possible. I feel more comfortable with an explicit edit button to enter edit mode.\n\nTurns out that Outline has support for turning off edit+read mode or what they refer to as Separate Editing. That's cool.\nWhen enabled, documents have a separate editing mode by default instead of being always editable. This setting can be overridden by user preferences.\n\n\n\nAI Query input box is not well designed for a larger prompt. It's a little annoying; I wish it auto-grows as one types more text.\n\n\n\nUpdate (Sept 20th, 2025)\nSuccessfully migrated all the content to Outline. While the team seems convinced, I will give it a week for the final decision.\nUpdate (Oct 9th, 2025)\nWe are happy with the migration. They have a Slack integration which is quite helpful, especially for quick AI queries.\n","id":"https://shon.github.io/blog/exploring-outline/","title":"Exploring Outline (getoutline.com) for Team Knowledgebase"},"https://shon.github.io/blog/getting-older-getting-better-and-better/":{"body":"Python programming is joy.
