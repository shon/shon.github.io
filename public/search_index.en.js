Ultimately\nwe have to paid the price of having to maintain really complex pure\njquery based bug-prone codebase. However at this stage, I decided to\nrectify this and started looking for different client side templating\nand MVC libraries. Essentially the library that binds the templates to\ndata and can auto-update as the data changes. I was stunned by choice of\nlibraries/frameworks available. There are just too many of them. Ones I\nliked are\n\nknockout.js\nangular.js\nEmber.js\nAgility\nknockback\n\nEmber is perhaps the best one even according to this\npost.\nAngular is very capable and is sheer magic. And well there are many more\nlike excellent backbone.js. We finally narrowed down two options:\nKnockout and Agility. Agility, I liked most, mainly because of it's\nclear syntax and looked like producing very maintainable code. So it was\nreally tempting to go for it. But for us at this point of time knockout\nscored better at mainly with it's project maturity (age). Agility is at\n0.1.2 at this moment and knockout 2.0.0 and hence knockout enjoys much\nbigger community.\nSo while we go ahead now with knockout I will certainly keep an eye on\nagility's development would love to find an excuse to use it.\n","id":"https://shon.github.io/blog/choosing-mvvc-library-for-cowspa/","title":"Choosing MVC(MVVM) library for Cowspa"},"https://shon.github.io/blog/configuring-your-ubuntu-for-faster-internet-access/":{"body":"While there is a lot already written here my quick howto\n$ sudo bash\n# apt-get install dnsmasq squid\n# echo \"listen-address=127.0.0.1\" &gt;&gt; /etc/dnsmasq.conf\n# echo \"no-dhcp-interface=\" &gt;&gt; /etc/dnsmasq.conf\n# vi /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf \n# # ^ uncomment line #prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;\n# vi /etc/resolv.conf  # Add nameserver 127.0.0.1 \n# /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart\n# vi /etc/squid/squid.conf \n\nhttp_port 3128\nvisible_hostname localhost\n\nacl all src 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0\n\ncache_effective_user proxy\ncache_effective_group proxy\n\nhttp_access allow all\nicp_access allow all\n\npositive_dns_ttl 1 month\nnegative_dns_ttl 1 minute\nhttpd_accel_port 80\nhttpd_accel_with_proxy on\nhttpd_accel_uses_host_header on\n\ncache_dir ufs /cache 400 16 256\ncache_store_log none         \n\n\n# mkdir /cache # I have this dir on reizerfs partition\n# chown proxy.proxy /cache\n\n# /etc/init.d/squid restart\n\nConfigure your browser to use 127.0.0.1:8080.

We are a bunch of\ngeeks who code for living.\n\nTickets were a bit expensive but we were really curious, reading with\npositive reviews all over (five stars and all). The expectation was\nwatching desi Lord of the rings equivalent. So winning argument in\nfavour of watching Bahubali was \"if they have sepnd 250cr making it, it\nshould be worth spending extra 150 Rs. to watch it\". Argument is sily\nbut fine, everyone really wanted to watch it. So we applied 20% discount\noffer on bookmyshow and booked the tickets.\nWe reached in time. And it began. Waterfall scenes were mesmerizing.\nInitial few minutes we were convinced that Bahubali is no ordinary boy\n.. he has great powers. Fine. He finds the mask and he decides to reach\ntop. Fine. As he reached top of the waterfall and the love story story\nbegins\nOh man .. from then until the interval it was crap [Crapbali]. Tatoo\nin flowing water, the heroine leading warriors and then convincing the\ntribe leader to have Bahubali lead them .. all so unconvincing even with\ncreative freedom. We were looking at each other with the feeling what\ncrap are we watching.\nAlright post interval Bada Bahubali appears and then things were bit\nmore interesting. Battle scene was epic and most of did enjoy it. But it\nwasn't without flaws either. How come Rani maa could watch such huge\nbattlefield like she is in some balcony watching a football or a cricket\nmatch .. and many more such logical questions.\nThen as we were walking back to office, we stopped at a cafe and then\ndiscussions started\n\nPD: Arey, me and Pi have a question for you\n\n\nME: Ok..\n\n\nPi: Who was the old lady who carried baby Bahubali through stream\n\n\nME: Umm.. had same question in my mind but let me think\n\n\nRR: See Rani maa was not Bahubali's real mother she was Duggubati's\nmother, right?\n\n\nME: You mean Bada Bahubali..\n\n\nPi: What about Devsena\n\n\n...\n...\n\nThere were more discussions and debates as we ordered some food. Two\nthings that everyone agreed on\n\nFirst half was utter crap\nSecond half was entertaining for sure but with many flaws\n\nBest scene in the movie\nKattappa doing Shahrukh Khan in a scene where he runs to\nkill chota Bahubali, changes his mind midway as he running and slides\nConclusion\nThey could have done better job with dialogues. I mean\n\nMera vachan hi hai shaasan\n\nwait .. what?\nSongs are forgettable, not sure why are they even there.\nGood movies stay in it's genre. For example many\nGovinda/Jim carry comedy movies do try to be serious. They often do one\nthing and do it well. Epic/Superhero/Disaster movies has great graphics\nbut most of the times do not try to be stupid love story.\nBahubali appeared to be intense historical fiction filled with struggle\nfor power, battles, politics. Sure there is place for tender love and\nhuman relations provided they are convincing. You can't turn on stupid\nmode for an hour long love story and then switch serious mode when\nsecond half begins.\nBahubali is big budget movie so there was no lack of resources to make a\ngreat movie. Still you can't help but get the feeling that the epic\nbattle scene is the only (technology) achievement but other than\nthat movie just disappoints on all fronts.\nAnd if you ask me to rate the movie... well two stars or may be just\none star .\nAlso read Wogma's review.\n","id":"https://shon.github.io/blog/crapbali/","title":"Crapbali"},"https://shon.github.io/blog/dns-migration-story/":{"body":"System administration is not my job but then sometimes I need to wear that hat to help the team.

I absolutely loved Tinkerer. I chose RestructuredText as the text markup, which was quiet popular that time among the Pythonistas during that era. \nMy blogging saga however took a backseat, with only sporadic ramblings on my stck account and for stck engg\nEarlier this year, ansht.me inspired me to revive this site again. I flirted with the idea of writing my own SSG. On realizing that even creating own SSG could have been ideal, it would be reinventing the wheel when there are already many great tools available.\nExisting tool Tinkerer is now retired. Tinkerer's spiritual successor Baku isn't ready yet. So I considered top tools Jekyll, Hugo and Zola.\nJekyll's is great and integrated with github but I wanted something easier to setup locally. So I tried Hugo and Zola. I could get Zola running in no time and loved it's simplicity.\nI wrote a script to port RestructuredText files to Markdown and restructure the source for Zola. \nAmong Zola themes, Anemone theme is fairly close to the minimalist style I was looking for. \nAlso spent some time customizing Zola for my requirement and taste. One of the customization is using JetBrains Mono font (inspiration: https://ansht.me). So all in all, the outcome is a rejuvenated blog space that felt just right, mirroring the simplicity and flexibility that I longed for.\nSo here’s to many more blog posts, code snippets, and the continuous quest for the perfect blogging setup! \n","id":"https://shon.github.io/blog/zola/","title":"Zola"},"https://shon.github.io/journal/":{"body":"","id":"https://shon.github.io/journal/","title":"Journal"},"https://shon.github.io/journal/2023-10-18/":{"body":"Hello Microblog / Journal / Short Notes\n","id":"https://shon.github.io/journal/2023-10-18/","title":""},"https://shon.github.io/journal/2023-10-19/":{"body":"Microblogging is fascinating.\nI love what Twitter has done and is doing.
