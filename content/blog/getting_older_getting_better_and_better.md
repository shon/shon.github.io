Python programming is joy. I was stuck on python 2.3 at my work for long
and could not really get chance to explore later versions. Now that I
got the opportunity doing re-architecture of the product I started
exploring these. I am more than excited looking at deque, groupby,
defaultdict and much more \... Also on top of it there exist excellent
python softwares like [twisted,](http://twistedmatrix.com)
[sqlalchemy](http://sqlalchemy.org), [turbogears](http://turbogears.org)
makes it even more cool.

It\'s little pity that the language is stll somewhat less recognized
than others. Or there are more hyped languages exist.
