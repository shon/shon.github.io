Sometime back, I have stumbled upon [getoutline.com](https://getoutline.com/) since then I wanted to explore it! If you haven't heard of it, Outline is a fantastic, open-source team knowledge base that's designed to be fast, collaborative, and super easy to use. It is a powerful and cost-effective option right off the bat! Though, I wish for a better domain name ðŸ˜‰.

My main goals for this exploration:

* **Migrate our existing GitHub Wiki**
* **Publish part of the wiki as a public help site**

So, how did it go? Let's dive in! ðŸ‘‡

## Minor Hurdle 1: Sign up

Could not sign up with individual email. One needs corp SSO account such Google workspace/Slack.

Signed up. Cloned my github wiki repository.

Used chatgpt to write a script that imports all the content (markdown and images) to outline using it's API.

## Minor hurdle 2: Rate Limits

API has somewhat restrictive rate limiting for import which was then overcome with 60 sec sleep between the calls.

Imported as a collection. Import works and looks great.

Figured out that `collection` can't published (public) directly. A document can be published and it's nested documents automatically be published.

Modified the script for this and then published. Worked perfect!

Now figuring out how to make certain links friendly. For example `/s/guide/doc/sharing-LG2sGOLIpl` to `/s/guide/doc/sharing` without the id suffix. [Documentation](https://docs.getoutline.com/s/guide/doc/sharing-LG2sGOLIpl) does say that it works but my guess it doesn't.

Here is the [script](https://gist.github.com/shon/247004a6bfbba47fe2cccbfcdf6fc394) if someone is interested

Custom domain is available for about $240 per year, so I am skipping that. Also there is no option in the settings but it's manual process based on support request. I decided to skip it.


## Conclusion
So far Outline experience has been positive! It's a user-friendly, and highly capable platform for managing team knowledge. Great APIs too. If you're looking for a powerful alternative to wikis/notion especially if you're on a budget, I highly recommend checking out [getoutline.com](https://getoutline.com/)!


## Update (Sept 20th, 2025)
- Migrated and started using it in production.
- One I miss is the ability of editing markdown files in your favorite editor (neovim in this case).
I feel overall WYSIWYG approach makes a product more accessible but makes both read and write a bit harder as the interface would have be ready to handle both intents. Example: Does the user want to edit the link or click it as I am reading?
