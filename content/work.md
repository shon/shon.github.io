## What I Offer

I assist startups in building scalable web applications. In the past, I have created a successful open-source product and operated a hosted service based on it. 

At present, I am architecting software and leading development teams.

## üïú Availability

Currently, I am engaged in building a platform, stck.me, for writers. While I am not actively seeking new opportunities, I am open to discussions should you have an intriguing proposal. 

If the project has a calling and depending on my availability, I may offer friendly advice, at no charge.

## Skills 

Python, Linux, Web Application Architecture

## Work Style

- I try to adhere to [KISS Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) 
- I strive to create codebases which equally enjoyable to maintain as they are to build
- Build and nourish culture that promotes openness, innovation and a flat hierarchy.

### Open Source

I am a fervent open-source enthusiast. In one of my ventures, I adopted a top-down open-source approach with 100% open-source code as well as an open business plan.

I love contributing to open-source projects whenever possible in various capacities. In most companies I have collaborated with, I encouraged the team to use and contribute back to open-source. I have initiated a few open-source projects and continue to maintain them.
