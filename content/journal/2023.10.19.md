Microblogging is fascinating.

I love what Twitter has done and is doing. Deeply admire Jack Dorsey and Elon. 

As much as I love Twitter, Rs. 650/mo for premium subscription would be too much for me. I wish there was a more affordable plan. 

I always wanted to have some form of microblogging in the products that I worked on in the past. That never really happened. But thatnks to Zola, now that my blog is alive again, I want to experiement with journal/microblogging system. So I spent a few minutes this morning and setup this quick microblog.

One downside of such microblog setups is no interactivity. Will think of comments a bit later.

- No Titles (If you compare with usual blog posts)
- Date as permalink
- New journal tagging - So that it's easy to just list journal posts by journal tags
